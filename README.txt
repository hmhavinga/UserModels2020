# User Models 2020: Get the Hint
This repository is made for the project "Get the Hint" for the course 'User Models' at the University of Groningen. In this project, participants will learn Finnish words using a system based on the SlimStampen algorithm by Hedderik van Rijn. 
If you participate in our experiment, you can find all information necessary to run the experiment below. 

## Installing Opensesame
In order to run the experiment, you need the Opensesame software. You can install it from anaconda by running 
`conda install -c cogsci python-opensesame`
or install it from https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.3/download/. 
Please make sure you have the latest version of OpenSesame installed. 
If you encounter any problems in getting started, feel free to ask us for help at m.d.los@student.rug.nl.

## Run experiment
The experiment consists of two phases, a training phase and a testing phase. Please first do the training phase and after !72 hours! (3 days) do the testing phase. After each phase, please send the csv-file with your results to m.d.los@student.rug.nl, please include your name and subject number (so we can keep track what results belong together).

### Training phase
In the training phase, you will be asked to learn Finnish words for approximately 20 minutes. To run the experiment, open the file 'Study.osexp' in OpenSesame, and click 'Run fullscreen' (the green play button at the top). You are asked to enter your subject number, please enter the number that you are in the Wiki sign-up. Save the csv-file with the results in a place that you will be able to find later. When you start the experiment, instructions will be provided. When you have finished the training phase, please send the csv-file with your results to m.d.los@student.rug.nl (including your name and number).

### Testing phase
In the testing phase, we will ask you to recall the words that you have learned in the training phase. Please do the testing phase !3 days! after you have done the training phase. In order to run this phase of the experiment, open the file 'Test.osexp', and click 'Run fullscreen' (the green play button at the top). Enter the same subject number that you have entered in the training phase, and save the csv-file in a similar way. More detailed instructions about the experiment itself will follow when you start the experiment. When you have finished the testing phase, please send the csv-file with your results again to m.d.los@student.rug.nl (including your name and number).

## Many thanks for participating!
